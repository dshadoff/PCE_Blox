# PCE_Blox

Falling Blocks-type game wrriten in Assembler for PC Engine in 1999


## Build

This was originally built with MagicKit 2.01; subsequent versions of the "standard"
library may have changed sematics which might cause it to no longer run.

I have included the standard INCLUDE library from MagicKit 2.0 in the "include" folder;
this is likely quite close, and I will come back to verify and adjust.

I will likely also come back to update the source base to allow for a more recent version
of the assembler to work (but to become a more self-contained build unit).
